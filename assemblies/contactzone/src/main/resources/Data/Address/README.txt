Dear Melissa Data Customer,

Melissa Data has recently upgraded our Canadian Address engine to use the newest and most accurate Canadian data available on the market. This data is in the included mdCanada_POCAD.db file. However, to use this file, you must have upgraded  your address object to a recently updated version. If you are still using an older address object, we have also included the older mdCanada3.db file for you to use. We highly recommend updating your address object and taking advantage of the new and improved data file. Please contact tech@melissadata.com for any questions or issues. We will continue to supply mdCanada3.db until the end of 2016 but we encourage all users to upgrade as soon as possible.

Thank you,
Melissa Data

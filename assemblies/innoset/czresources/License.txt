    (a) Right to Install and Use. 
		
        (1) Standalone Computer - Single Installation You may install
             and use the Software on the hard disk drive of any single 
             compatible non-server computer that you own. However, you may
             not under any circumstances have the Software installed onto 
             the hard drives of two or more computers at the same time,
             (nor may you install the Software onto the hard disk drive of
             one computer and then use the original CD-ROM on another 
             computer). If you wish to use the Software on more than one
             computer, you must either erase the Software from the first
             hard drive before you install it onto a second hard drive, 
             or else license an additional copy of the Software for each
             additional computer on which you want to use it.

        (2) Network Use: If the single computer on which you install the
             Software is a network or Internet server, you may use the
             Software on any computer attached to the network, provided that
             it is only installed on the server. You may install and use this
             Software on a single file server regardless of the number of
             workstations attached to the network.
 
    (b) Right to Copy. You may copy the Software for backup and archival
         purposes, provided that the original and each copy is kept in your
         possession, and that your installation and use of the Software does
         not exceed that allowed in part (a) above. 

        (1) Solely with the respect to the manual and Help files, you may
             make an unlimited number of copies (either in hard-copy or
             electronic form), provided that such copies shall be used only
             for internal purposes and are not republished or distributed
             beyond the licensee's premises.
        (2) Copy, bundle, or redistribute the DEMO software with any
             commercial product (including books, CD- ROM, computer
             hardware, or software products). Your promotional and/or
             packaging materials must clearly disclose that the Software is
             copyrighted software of Melissa DATA, that no charge is made
             by Melissa DATA or you for it, and that it is not a fully
             supported commercial version.

         computer program to the extent necessary for your own use on (a single
         computer or server as specified above); however, any portion of the
         Software merged into another computer program will continue to be subject
         to the terms of this Agreement. You may use and modify the source code
         version of those Software portions that the documentation identifies as
         sample code ("SAMPLE CODE"), provided you do not distribute the
         SAMPLE CODE or any modified version of the SAMPLE CODE, in source
         form. 

    (d) Right to Transfer. You may not rent, lend, or lease this Software.
         However, you may transfer this license to use the Software to another
         party on a permanent basis by transferring this copy of the License
         Agreement, at least one unaltered copy of the Software, and all
         documentation. You must, at the same time, either transfer to the other
         party or destroy all your other copies of the Software or destroy all of
         your copies. Such transfer of possession terminates your license from us.

         its acceptance of this Agreement by its initial use of the Software. If
         you transfer the Software, you must remove the Software from your hard disk
